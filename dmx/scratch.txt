# Dragon eye:
# Channel 1: Master dimmer, overrides all RGB dimmers. Would just use 0 for off and 255 for ON, or just leave alwayw on tbh...
# Channel 2: Red dimmer, 0 is off, 255 is max. 255 is blinding. 155 is very bright but not blinding. 30 is ok but not weak.
# Channel 3: Green dimmer, 0 is off, 255 is max. 255 is blinding. 155 is very bright but not blinding. 30 is ok but not weak.
# Channel 4: Blue dimmer, 0 is off, 255 is max. 255 is blinding. 155 is very bright but not blinding. 30 is ok but not weak.
# Channel 5 is skip mode. Very undocumented. Various blinks from 200-255. Not very useful imho and probably easier to program ourselves.
# Channel 6 is strobe speed. 255 is seisure fast. 100 is airstrip kind of blink. 10 is kinda similar to 100.
# Channel 7 seems useless. A combo of the skip and strobe above, and also has a "fade mode" that only seems like preprogrammed fades.
# Trenger minst 0.2 sek mellom man raiser lys, og man tar de ned igjen, om ikke blir det st√∏gt.

# Smoke machine:
# Channel 1: Smoke emission
# Channel 2: Red ligjt
# Channel 3: Green light
# Channel 4: Blue light
# Channel 5: LED flash
# Channel 6: 30-179 is color fade, 180-255 is color skip
# Channel 7: Speed adjust (ooooh!) - seems kinda BS. 1 is just forever slow, and any value over 50 is near instant.

# Colors do mix! But not evenly.
# Smoke on is quite precise, but smoke off isnt
# Compared to the eyes, here you can actually smoothly while loop all the way up and down without any sleep.
# ... seems like the LED par cans are kinda shit:D
# (Should have known given the price...)
